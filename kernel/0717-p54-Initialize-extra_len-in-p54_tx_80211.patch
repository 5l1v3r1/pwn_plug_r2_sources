Subject: [PATCH 717/984] p54: Initialize extra_len in p54_tx_80211

commit a6756da9eace8b4af73e9dea43f1fc2889224c94 upstream.

This patch fixes a very serious off-by-one bug in
the driver, which could leave the device in an
unresponsive state.

The problem was that the extra_len variable [used to
reserve extra scratch buffer space for the firmware]
was left uninitialized. Because p54_assign_address
later needs the value to reserve additional space,
the resulting frame could be to big for the small
device's memory window and everything would
immediately come to a grinding halt.
