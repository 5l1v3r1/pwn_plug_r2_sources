Subject: [PATCH 826/984] powerpc/kexec: Fix memory corruption from unallocated
 slaves

commit 3d2cea732d68aa270c360f55d8669820ebce188a upstream.

Commit 1fc711f7ffb01089efc58042cfdbac8573d1b59a (powerpc/kexec: Fix race
in kexec shutdown) moved the write to signal the cpu had exited the kernel
from before the transition to real mode in kexec_smp_wait to kexec_wait.

Unfornately it missed that kexec_wait is used both by cpus leaving the
kernel and by secondary slave cpus that were not allocated a paca for
what ever reason -- they could be beyond nr_cpus or not described in
the current device tree for whatever reason (for example, kexec-load
was not refreshed after a cpu hotplug operation).  Cpus coming through
that path they will write to paca[NR_CPUS] which is beyond the space
allocated for the paca data and overwrite memory not allocated to pacas
but very likely still real mode accessable).

Move the write back to kexec_smp_wait, which is used only by cpus that
found their paca, but after the transition to real mode.
