Subject: [PATCH 331/984] mmc: Fix re-probing with PM_POST_RESTORE notification

commit 274476f8fe0b6ac9bac542cc39de12c3dd0f43f6 upstream.

In the error-path where PM notifies PM_POST_RESTORE, the rescan-blockage
should be cleared as well.  Otherwise it'll be never re-probed.

Also, as a bonus, this fixes a bug in S4 with user-mode suspend in the
current code, as it sends PM_POST_RESTORE instead of
PM_POST_HIBERNATION wrongly.
