Subject: [PATCH 581/984] shmem: let shared anonymous be nonlinear again

commit bee4c36a5cf5c9f63ce1d7372aa62045fbd16d47 upstream.

Up to 2.6.22, you could use remap_file_pages(2) on a tmpfs file or a
shared mapping of /dev/zero or a shared anonymous mapping.  In 2.6.23 we
disabled it by default, but set VM_CAN_NONLINEAR to enable it on safe
mappings.  We made sure to set it in shmem_mmap() for tmpfs files, but
missed it in shmem_zero_setup() for the others.  Fix that at last.
