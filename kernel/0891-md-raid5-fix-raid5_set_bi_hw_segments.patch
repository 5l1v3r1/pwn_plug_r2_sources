Subject: [PATCH 891/984] md/raid5: fix raid5_set_bi_hw_segments

commit 9b2dc8b665932a8e681a7ab3237f60475e75e161 upstream.

The @bio->bi_phys_segments consists of active stripes count in the
lower 16 bits and processed stripes count in the upper 16 bits. So
logical-OR operator should be bitwise one.

This bug has been present since 2.6.27 and the fix is suitable for any
-stable kernel since then.  Fortunately the bad code is only used on
error paths and is relatively unlikely to be hit.
